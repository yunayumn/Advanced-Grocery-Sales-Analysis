# Advanced-Grocery-Sales-Analysis

This project provides an advanced sales performance analysis for a grocery retail business. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer behavior.

## Tools Used

- **BigQuery:** Used as a mandatory tool to analyze large-scale datasets.

- **DBeaver:** Served as the primary SQL client for connecting to databases, writing queries, and exploring data.

- **DuckDB:** Utilized for its fast and local data analysis tasks.

## Project Structure and Contents

This repository is organized into three main parts, each representing a key phase of the analysis:

1. **Data Creation and Data Cleaning:** Contains the SQL scripts and queries used to generate and clean the raw sales data. This section ensures the data is in a usable format for analysis.

2. **Business Analysis Queries:** A collection of SQL queries designed to answer specific business questions. These queries were used to calculate KPIs, identify sales trends, and segment customers.

3. **Business Insights Deck:** A presentation or report summarizing the key findings from the analysis. It visually communicates the insights, providing a clear overview of sales performance, top-performing products, and strategic recommendations.
